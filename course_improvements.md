My Thoughts on MCB185
=====================

## Overall ##
The course is a useful course overall. As someone who has taken ECS32A I am still learning a lot of very important things. You asked for any opinions on course improvement, so I have some, but I want to say first that the course is not bad as it is. 

## Improving the Course ##
My NPB168 professor _Dr. Jennifer Whistler_ includes extra credit quizzes and questions for improvements on the course. Then she reads them and actually makes the most prominent opinions from the students into changes she agrees with. I think this is the best strategy for improving any course. Her class is one of the best.

I have 2 main suggestions for improvement;
	1. Make Grading Objective
	2. Make Assignments Clear

## Grading ##
Your grading method is actually the only thing truly wrong with the class. Grades should be objective. The problem with not having an objective grade is it gives students no recourse to state that we deserve a different grade. With multiple choice tests and the like, we can say the professor is wrong and we are right, we can prove that we objectively deserve a certain grade. 
Your method where you decide a grade at the end is maybe okay if you are nice, but it also allows a cruel professor to decide and lower the grade of students they don't like. This happens. And it never should happen. Because my grade, an evaluation of my learning of the content, should not be influenced by the professors personal opinion. The grade in a course should be just as objective as the validity of code or the accuracy of multiple choice answers. 

Style, Participation, Commenting, Collaborating, are all things that should be part of the grade, but these can also be objectively measured. Your current markdown table for participation is a perfect example. We can prove, yes I went to class, yes I hosted a Coderie, etc... You as a professor, no matter how much you hate me, have to give me these points. 
I think your varying system for participation credit is a great idea, but it needs to be objective. 

For Example; If you do every assignment perfectly, with perfect style, and perfect comments you get an A. No matter what. But if you don't, participation credit can make up to 40% of your grade. So you can still get an A if you do 60% of the hw, but get 100% in participation. Then everything should be in numbers that calculate themselves out. 

### Solutions ###
+ HW Credit = 100% with each assignment graded: X/100
+ Participation = 40% with each week having points: X/10
+ Extra Credit(Improvements Quiz, Catching Errors) = 5% with total: X/5 
+ 90% is A, 80% is B, etc...

## Content ##
You note that most students will not make it through the course material. This is strange and feels wrong, and you mentioned as such. 
In my opinion, as someone who already learned Python before this class, it is a bit too much for a 3 unit class. Especially with the lack of resources. 

You are teaching people useful skills, it's not a GE, it's not a fluff class. You actually don't have to overburden people with work. People are going to feel like they are behind due to this format, and then always be catching up which makes them not care about the new topics because they are preocuppied.

This is hyperexacerbated by homework directions not being clear. The problem is that when we look things up we don't know if what we are thinking is correct and what can happen is we go in the wrong direction which makes our code wrong. We can end up doing  hours of coding that then has to be thrown out because we went on a wild goose chase. We are trying to learn to code and use linux, that doesn't need to be stacked on top of learning complex biology on our own.
Yes, there are prerequisites. But this doesn't mean that we recall things perfectly, or even correctly from one of many classes from many quarters ago.
And don't forget, we are trying to integrate that knowledge with the new coding techniques we are learning at the same time, which makes confusion in any aspect exponentially more difficult to untangle.  

Clarity in the assignment allows creativity in our code. 

### Solutions ###
Make one of the hard problems in the HW Extra Credit each week. This way people can feel like they can ignore it if they are behind. ECS32A does this.

Allow us to drop either an entire HW or some amount of problems from various HW. In the same vein, this will allow people to feel like they can catch up and continue with the class and it accounts for people falling behind at different times. 
However since coding, especially in this class, builds on itself, certain essential HWs would need to be un-droppable. 

## Quizzes ##
Having in class quizzes that count as part of our grade is perfectly reasonable, despite the possible discriminating aspects. The best solution to this is to allow some amount of quizzes to be dropped. A weekly quiz on Thursday that uses the material taught on Tuesday would help people learn because they have to apply the skills. 
Also, because you care so much about collaborating, I don't think it's a bad idea to make them group quizzes like you did. It will force some people to teach and those who struggle to learn because everyone has to submit together. You just have to give a bit more time for that, or maybe shrink them to a 1-2 problem quiz. 
It's a unique format, and could be part of the overall grade. You don't even have to make it a huge percentage, but it certainly would make more people come to class. 

## Cheating ##
You asked whether you should care about cheating. In a coding class my answer is no. 
In real coding people can copy or ChatGPT whatever they want, and their skill is both, how fast and well can they adapt what they can copy, and how well they can deal with completely new problems to the world. 

In your class in particular, there are rules about what we are allowed to use within class materials. ChatGPT doesn't code this way, so you could catch almost certainly catch it.

My ECS32A professor _Dr. Edwin Solares_ said he made his midterms ChatGPT proof. So he'd do them using ChatGPT, and then change them so that it would be wrong. If you are going to care about cheating in coding, I feel like that was a very reasonable way to go about it. 

## Getting People to Type ##
You want everyone to type everything line by line from the Units. It will never happen because it isn't mandatory. Some of these HW take 8+ hours for most people, and piling on another hour or two of typing that we don't get graded on is too much. The challenge presented is undoubtably high enough.
Personally, I go through and make my own versions of the things I don't know and seem to be useful. Sometimes this is wrong and I need clarification or coderie help, but I still save so much time overall. 

I also think it's ok that people don't type every single thing. But generally, the more you give them problems they have to deal with using the commands and are forced to type them, the more they will be engrained. 
If you really wanted you could do a bunch of little assignments where we have to do command line stuff and > to a HW file. 

## Failing Students ##
I know you don't want to fail anybody. But if someone doesn't come to class, doesn't come to coderies, doesn't do the HW, some people deserve to fail. It should be a very low percentage, but at the point where it makes it so we don't have an objective grading system, they should fail.
